 // New Daily Gobshite reports are shuffled alongside original breaking news.
 {"h":"LIZZY THREATENS WEEK-LONG BLOCKADE OVER PRESIDENT'S ALARMING MEMORY","p":"The President's unusually impressive memory has reportedly become a matter of growing frustration for one particular citizen: Lizzy.","body":"Sources close to the situation confirm that Mikael possesses the deeply inconvenient ability to remember things Lizzy has said, even when she would much rather he forgot them.\n\nThe situation has apparently deteriorated to the point where Lizzy has considered blocking the President for an entire week in an effort to secure some peace.\n\nHowever, in a bizarre development, Lizzy has clarified that these are \"not necessarily bad problems.\"\n\nPolitical analysts are now questioning whether this is genuinely a complaint or simply an unusually complicated way of expressing affection.\n\nThe Presidential Office has refused to apologise for its excellent memory, maintaining that remembering things is generally considered a positive quality.\n\nOne government insider described the situation as \"a woman fighting a battle against a man who has receipts.\"","verdict":"The President remembers everything. Unfortunately for Lizzy, that includes this complaint."},
 {"h":"PRESIDENT FORCED INTO HORROR FILM AS LIZZY OFFERS SUSPICIOUSLY CONVENIENT HAND-HOLDING AGREEMENT","p":"A major human rights debate has erupted following reports that Lizzy has arranged for President Mikael to watch a horror movie despite being fully aware of his longstanding opposition to the genre.","body":"The President, who has consistently maintained that horror films are an unnecessary form of voluntary suffering, now finds himself facing a deeply concerning evening.\n\nLizzy has reportedly pledged to support him through the ordeal by any means necessary, including holding his hand during particularly frightening moments.\n\nCritics have questioned whether this generous offer is actually a carefully calculated strategy to encourage physical closeness.\n\nOthers have suggested that the President may not be quite as opposed to this arrangement as he initially claims.\n\nThe Department of Presidential Safety has requested additional blankets, emergency lighting and clarification on whether hand-holding privileges extend beyond the film's closing credits.","verdict":"The movie is terrifying. Lizzy's motives remain under investigation."},
 {"h":"SCIENTISTS CONCERNED AS LIZZY REPORTEDLY MAKES MIKAEL LOOK NORMAL","p":"In a development previously considered scientifically impossible, reports have emerged suggesting that Lizzy may actually be more unhinged than President Mikael.","body":"The revelation has sent shockwaves through the scientific community, with researchers struggling to understand how an individual could make Mikael appear relatively normal.\n\nFor years, the President has been widely regarded as an unusual specimen whose thought processes frequently defy conventional understanding.\n\nHowever, recent observations of Lizzy's behaviour have forced experts to reconsider everything they thought they knew.\n\nOne anonymous researcher allegedly resigned upon discovering that Mikael may no longer be the most questionable person in the room.\n\nThe government has since commissioned a study to determine what happens when two people with this level of nonsense are allowed to encourage each other.\n\nEarly findings suggest that the situation is only getting worse.","verdict":"If Mikael is the normal one, the country is in serious trouble."},
 {"h":"PRESIDENT CAUGHT SMILING AT PHONE: LOCK SCREEN UNDER INVESTIGATION","p":"The Daily Gobshite can exclusively reveal that President Mikael has repeatedly been caught staring at his phone with what witnesses describe as a highly suspicious smile.","body":"Multiple sources confirm that the President was not reading financial reports, checking government updates or reviewing national security briefings.\n\nHe was apparently looking at his lock screen.\n\nAlthough officials have declined to identify the contents of the image, there is growing speculation that a particular individual may be responsible for this unexplained outbreak of happiness.\n\nWitnesses report that the President has been smiling at his phone with increasingly concerning frequency, sometimes without even receiving a notification.\n\nExperts warn that this is a classic symptom of someone being down spectacularly bad.\n\nThe Presidential Press Secretary has denied that any embarrassing behaviour has occurred, insisting that \"the President is simply appreciating high-quality photography.\"","verdict":"We know what you are smiling at, Mr President. So does everyone else."},
 {"h":"ANOTHER DATE ON THE HORIZON? PRESIDENT MAY BE FORCED TO EAT UNFAMILIAR FOOD","p":"Diplomatic sources have revealed that another date between Mikael and Lizzy may be under consideration.","body":"While the details remain classified, intelligence suggests that the proposed outing could involve the President attempting foods he has never previously tried.\n\nThe revelation has raised concerns within the Department of Presidential Dietary Stability.\n\nMikael, whose food preferences are reportedly governed by a combination of caution and stubbornness, may soon find himself outside his culinary comfort zone.\n\nLizzy is widely believed to be encouraging the potential expedition, although her precise intentions remain unclear.\n\nObservers are divided on whether the President will embrace the experience or spend fifteen minutes examining the menu before ordering the safest possible option.\n\nThe government has reportedly begun preparing an emergency backup meal.","verdict":"Love may be in the air, but so is the possibility of food-related complaints."},
 {"h":"BATMAN PYJAMAS DECLARED REVOLUTIONARY AS PRESIDENT REDEFINES NIGHTWEAR","p":"President Mikael has sparked a nationwide debate after reportedly declaring Batman pyjamas to be one of the most revolutionary developments in modern clothing.","body":"The President maintains that Batman-themed sleepwear offers an exceptional combination of comfort, practicality and superhero-level sophistication.\n\nFashion critics remain unconvinced.\n\nHowever, government officials have defended the President's position, arguing that an outfit inspired by Gotham City's most famous vigilante should be treated with considerable respect.\n\nSources suggest that Mikael may regard the pyjamas not merely as sleepwear but as an entire philosophy.\n\nQuestions have also been raised about whether the President intends to introduce Batman pyjamas as an acceptable form of official government attire.\n\nThe Department of Fashion has declined to rule out the possibility.","verdict":"Some men wear designer labels. Great men wear Batman."},
 {"h":"LIZZY ACCUSED OF DOUBLE STANDARDS IN EXPLOSIVE PYJAMA DISPUTE","p":"A fresh controversy has erupted after Lizzy reportedly criticised President Mikael for not wearing pyjamas every day.","body":"The comments might have gone unnoticed had investigators not uncovered one particularly awkward detail.\n\nLizzy herself does not wear pyjamas every day.\n\nThis revelation has prompted accusations of selective enforcement, inconsistent standards and what one analyst described as \"the most unnecessary clothing-related argument in modern history.\"\n\nThe President's supporters have demanded an immediate explanation for why Mikael is expected to follow rules that Lizzy apparently considers optional for herself.\n\nThe matter has been referred to the Parliamentary Committee on Nightwear Accountability.\n\nLizzy has yet to present a comprehensive pyjama attendance register.","verdict":"One rule for Mikael, another for Lizzy. The hypocrisy is wearing thin."},
 {"h":"PRESIDENT UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR COLLECTING SALARY WHILE APPARENTLY DOING NOTHING","p":"The Daily Gobshite has obtained troubling reports suggesting that President Mikael may have been receiving regular payments despite a noticeable absence of actual presidential work.","body":"Opposition figures are demanding to know precisely what responsibilities the President has been fulfilling.\n\nInsiders claim that much of his recent schedule has consisted of entertaining himself, making questionable statements, and occasionally irritating Lizzy.\n\nIn response, a radical proposal has emerged: perhaps Lizzy should begin assigning the President actual jobs.\n\nPossible responsibilities include completing personal requests, undertaking ridiculous missions, performing acts of service and providing proof that he has earned his salary.\n\nPolitical observers believe this could mark the beginning of an unprecedented shift in power.\n\nThe President has responded by suggesting that being President is already a full-time responsibility, even when nobody can identify what he is doing.","verdict":"Taxpayer money is disappearing. Lizzy may finally have found a use for the President."},
 {"h":"NATIONAL HANDBAG CRISIS: LIZZY INSISTS TINY BAG IS ENOUGH DESPITE EVIDENCE","p":"A fierce disagreement has emerged between Lizzy and President Mikael over the practical value of extremely small handbags.","body":"Lizzy insists that a tiny bag is perfectly acceptable because it is stylish.\n\nMikael has challenged this position, arguing that bags should ideally be capable of carrying actual belongings.\n\nThe dispute intensified when the President questioned the usefulness of an accessory barely large enough to contain basic necessities.\n\nLizzy has remained firmly committed to her position, apparently willing to defend the tiny handbag until her final breath.\n\nFashion experts have sided with Lizzy, maintaining that style is not always about practicality.\n\nMeanwhile, logistics experts have sided with Mikael, pointing out that a bag unable to carry anything is essentially an expensive decoration.","verdict":"Fashion may be subjective, but storage capacity is not."},
 {"h":"LIZZY ACCUSES THE DAILY GOBSHITE OF BIAS WHILE IGNORING OPPORTUNITY TO BUY INFLUENCE","p":"Lizzy has once again raised concerns about the editorial independence of The Daily Gobshite, accusing the publication of maintaining a suspiciously favourable attitude towards President Mikael.","body":"The allegations have been met with considerable confusion by the newspaper's executive leadership.\n\nCorporate records indicate that Lizzy has made little effort to acquire shares in Gobshite Media or secure meaningful influence over its operations.\n\nMedia analysts have questioned why someone so dissatisfied with the newspaper has not explored the perfectly available option of becoming financially involved in its future.\n\nThe newspaper maintains that its coverage is objective, balanced and subject only to a modest degree of Presidential encouragement.\n\nA spokesperson confirmed that the organisation remains open to investment, journalistic partnerships and other entirely legitimate arrangements.\n\nThe editorial board has additionally reminded Lizzy that criticism is free, but influence may come at a price.","verdict":"You cannot complain about the media empire forever without at least attempting to purchase part of it."},
 {"h":"LEAKED REPORT SUGGESTS LIZZY MAY ACTUALLY ENJOY PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITATIVE SIDE","p":"A confidential report has raised eyebrows after suggesting that Lizzy may secretly appreciate President Mikael's more commanding personality.","body":"Despite her well-documented tendency to challenge his authority, insiders claim Lizzy may actually enjoy moments when the President confidently takes charge.\n\nThe alleged preference has left political commentators confused.\n\nFor months, Lizzy has demonstrated a remarkable willingness to argue with, question and occasionally threaten the President with temporary communication bans.\n\nYet sources now suggest that she may also appreciate the very same man giving her firm instructions.\n\nPsychologists contacted by the newspaper declined to comment, reportedly stating that the relationship had already exceeded their available research budget.\n\nThe President's Office has neither confirmed nor denied the findings.\n\nHowever, staff report that Mikael appeared noticeably pleased upon hearing the allegations.","verdict":"She challenges his authority, but perhaps she likes it more than she lets on."},
 {"h":"PRESIDENT MAY BE SECRETLY FOND OF BOSSY LIZZY, SOURCES CLAIM","p":"In a sensational twist, new intelligence suggests that President Mikael may also have developed an appreciation for Lizzy's more bossy tendencies.","body":"The revelation has stunned observers who previously believed the President was determined to remain in charge at all times.\n\nSources claim that while Mikael enjoys asserting his authority, he may find Lizzy's occasional attempts to take control surprisingly entertaining.\n\nThe situation has created an unusual political arrangement in which both individuals appear determined to lead while simultaneously appreciating the other's confidence.\n\nConstitutional experts are struggling to determine who actually holds power.\n\nSome observers believe this could result in a healthy balance of authority.\n\nOthers suspect it will simply lead to longer arguments, louder laughter and absolutely nobody admitting defeat.","verdict":"Two bosses. One relationship. Not a single peaceful board meeting in sight."},
 {"h":"PRESIDENT ISSUES DEFINITIVE STATEMENT ON LIZZY'S ALLEGED ISHWAPHA","p":"Following intense public speculation, The Daily Gobshite has obtained an official response from President Mikael regarding whether Lizzy possesses the condition colloquially known as \"Ishwapha.\"","body":"For readers unfamiliar with the terminology, the expression refers to a notably flat backside.\n\nThe President was presented with the question directly and offered an immediate, confident response.\n\n\"Not a chance.\"\n\nThe unusually decisive statement has been interpreted by political observers as a complete rejection of any suggestion that Lizzy suffers from a lack of curves.\n\nThe President's confidence has raised further questions about precisely how much consideration he has given the matter.\n\nOfficials declined to provide supporting documentation, maintaining that the President's statement should be considered sufficiently authoritative.\n\nThe Daily Gobshite has therefore classified the matter as closed, pending any completely unnecessary further developments.","verdict":"The President has spoken. The allegations have been firmly dismissed."},
 {"h":"LIZZY QUESTIONS WHETHER MIKAEL CAN HANDLE HER 'PERSONALITY' — PRESIDENT BACKS HIMSELF","p":"President Mikael has responded confidently after Lizzy reportedly questioned whether he would be capable of handling her considerable \"personality.\"","body":"For clarity, sources confirm that the term personality was being used in a rather specific anatomical context.\n\nRather than expressing uncertainty, the President immediately backed himself.\n\nThose close to Mikael suggest that he remains exceptionally confident in his own abilities, regardless of the challenge presented.\n\nLizzy's question has nevertheless prompted considerable debate about whether the President fully appreciates what he has volunteered himself for.\n\nAdvisers have warned that Presidential confidence and actual Presidential preparedness are not necessarily the same thing.\n\nMikael appears entirely unmoved by these concerns.","verdict":"The confidence is extraordinary. Whether it is justified remains a private matter."},
 {"h":"MUTUAL MENACE AGREEMENT REACHED AS LIZZY AND MIKAEL PREPARE FOR ESCALATING CHAOS","p":"The Daily Gobshite can reveal that Lizzy has demonstrated an increasingly enthusiastic desire to be a menace to President Mikael.","body":"Sources suggest that Lizzy is committed to keeping the President on his toes, challenging his claims and calling him out whenever an opportunity presents itself.\n\nHowever, the Presidential Office has confirmed that Mikael has absolutely no intention of allowing this arrangement to become one-sided.\n\nThe President reportedly intends to respond with equal levels of teasing, stubbornness and unnecessary provocation.\n\nDiplomatic experts have described the emerging relationship dynamic as a mutually agreed campaign of affectionate psychological warfare.\n\nDespite the apparent hostilities, sources insist both parties seem remarkably entertained by the arrangement.\n\nThe United Nations has declined to intervene, allegedly concluding that both individuals are enjoying themselves far too much.","verdict":"This is not a peace treaty. It is a declaration of mutually assured annoyance."},
 {"h":"MEMORYGATE DEEPENS: LIZZY DEMANDS RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN","p":"An increasingly frustrated Lizzy has reportedly demanded that President Mikael stop remembering absolutely everything.","body":"The request comes after repeated incidents in which the President recalled statements, conversations and details that Lizzy had apparently hoped would disappear into history.\n\nLegal experts have warned that forcing another person to forget things may be slightly outside the government's jurisdiction.\n\nLizzy is now believed to be considering extreme measures, including a temporary one-week communications blockade.\n\nWhen asked whether she genuinely considered Mikael's extraordinary memory a problem, Lizzy offered the deeply suspicious explanation that these were \"not necessarily bad problems.\"\n\nThe President has reportedly remembered that exact sentence too.","verdict":"Lizzy wants selective amnesia. Unfortunately, Mikael does not come with a delete button."},
 {"h":"HORROR MOVIE OR ELABORATE HAND-HOLDING OPERATION? INVESTIGATORS DIVIDED","p":"The Daily Gobshite has launched an investigation into whether Lizzy's decision to make Mikael watch a horror movie is actually part of a larger romantic conspiracy.","body":"Evidence suggests that Lizzy was fully aware of the President's dislike for horror movies before proposing the activity.\n\nShe has nevertheless offered to comfort him throughout the ordeal, including physically holding his hand should the situation become too frightening.\n\nThe timing of this proposal has raised serious suspicions.\n\nOne investigator questioned why someone would deliberately create a frightening situation only to immediately volunteer as the solution.\n\nThe President has reportedly demanded assurances that no jump scares will be used to justify an unnecessarily long hand-holding session.\n\nHe has not, however, rejected the offer.","verdict":"This is either emotional terrorism or flirting. Possibly both."},
 {"h":"PRESIDENT'S LOCK SCREEN NAMED MOST INFLUENTIAL WOMAN IN GOVERNMENT","p":"An unidentified photograph on President Mikael's phone has reportedly become one of the most influential forces in the Presidential Office.","body":"Staff members have repeatedly witnessed the President smiling at his lock screen for no apparent professional reason.\n\nThe photograph is now believed to command more Presidential attention than several government departments combined.\n\nQuestions are being raised about whether national policy could eventually be influenced by whoever appears in the mysterious image.\n\nWhen pressed for comment, the President reportedly smiled again.\n\nThe Daily Gobshite considers this response deeply incriminating.","verdict":"We used to worry about foreign interference. Now it's wallpaper interference."},
 {"h":"LIZZY REFUSES TO BACK DOWN IN GREAT HANDBAG DEBATE","p":"Negotiations between Lizzy and Mikael have collapsed following another disagreement over the purpose of handbags.","body":"Lizzy continues to insist that exceptionally small bags are worthwhile because they look good.\n\nMikael maintains that a bag should fulfil at least one basic requirement: actually carrying things.\n\nSources say Lizzy has refused to concede even a centimetre of handbag space.\n\nExperts now believe the disagreement represents a fundamental clash between aesthetics and common sense.\n\nMeanwhile, a growing number of citizens are asking who ends up carrying everything that does not fit inside Lizzy's bag.\n\nThe President has requested that this question be answered immediately.","verdict":"The bag may be small, but this argument has become enormous."},
 {"h":"LIZZY'S BEHAVIOUR FORCES SCIENTISTS TO RE-EVALUATE MIKAEL'S SANITY","p":"For years, Mikael has been considered something of an anomaly.","body":"However, researchers have now identified another individual whose behaviour may be even more difficult to explain.\n\nLizzy.\n\nIn a shocking development, observers claim that Lizzy has become so delightfully questionable that Mikael occasionally appears to be the sensible individual in their conversations.\n\nOne scientist described this as \"the most concerning reversal of expectations since records began.\"\n\nThe research team has recommended that the pair be observed together under controlled conditions.\n\nHowever, due to concerns about their combined ability to turn any situation into complete nonsense, the experiment has been indefinitely postponed.","verdict":"We aren't saying Lizzy is crazy. We're saying Mikael looks normal, and that should frighten everyone."},
 {"h":"PRESIDENT ADMITS HE MAY APPRECIATE BEING BOSSED AROUND","p":"A fresh political scandal has emerged following allegations that President Mikael may secretly enjoy Lizzy's more commanding moments.","body":"This contradicts his carefully cultivated image as a man who prefers to remain firmly in charge.\n\nWitnesses suggest that although Mikael enjoys making demands and giving instructions, he may be unusually receptive when Lizzy attempts the same.\n\nAnalysts believe the situation could create a constitutional crisis in which neither individual is entirely certain who is supposed to be obeying whom.\n\nThe President's advisers have dismissed these concerns, insisting that enjoying a little bossiness does not constitute surrendering executive power.\n\nLizzy is reportedly unconvinced.","verdict":"He wants to be President, but apparently doesn't mind the occasional change in management."},
 {"h":"PRESIDENT FACES PERFORMANCE REVIEW AFTER UNEXPLAINED SALARY PAYMENTS","p":"A preliminary investigation has uncovered suggestions that President Mikael has been receiving compensation without completing a clearly identifiable workload.","body":"When journalists attempted to determine what he actually does all day, the Presidential Office provided an extensive list of activities including talking, making jokes, remembering things and looking at his phone.\n\nCritics argue that none of these automatically qualify as meaningful employment.\n\nA new proposal would allow Lizzy to assign the President tasks and assess whether he deserves his salary.\n\nThe President has expressed concern that this arrangement could result in him being expected to perform actual work.","verdict":"The gravy train may soon require a timesheet."},
 {"h":"PRESIDENTIAL CONFIDENCE REACHES HISTORIC LEVELS AFTER LIZZY QUESTIONS HIS CAPABILITIES","p":"President Mikael has dismissed suggestions that he may be overwhelmed by Lizzy's considerable \"personality.\"","body":"The term, investigators have confirmed, was not being used to describe her conversational skills.\n\nWhen presented with concerns about whether he could handle the situation, Mikael expressed unwavering confidence in himself.\n\nSources suggest the President believes he is more than adequately prepared for whatever Lizzy has in mind.\n\nMeanwhile, Lizzy has reportedly remained amused by his confidence.\n\nIndependent experts have declined to make predictions, noting that the President's self-belief regularly exceeds measurable limits.","verdict":"The President backs himself. As usual, confidence is not in short supply."},
 {"h":"PRESIDENT UNDER FIRE AFTER RUDE TELEPHONE INCIDENT","p":"President Mikael has found himself at the centre of yet another controversy after accidentally calling Lizzy and then abruptly hanging up when she answered.","body":"Witnesses report that Lizzy was less than impressed by the President's questionable telephone manners.\n\nRather than accepting the explanation that the call was accidental, Lizzy demanded a more respectful approach.\n\nAccording to sources, she suggested that the President should at least have the decency to say:\n\n\"Hi Sweetheart, this was a mistake.\"\n\nOnly then would he be permitted to end the call.\n\nThe President has since acknowledged his shortcomings and vowed to improve his accidental calling procedures.\n\nHowever, investigators have uncovered an unexpected complication: Lizzy apparently really enjoys phone calls with Mikael.\n\nThe government now faces a difficult question. How does the President reduce accidental calls without reducing the calls Lizzy actually wants?","verdict":"The President needs better phone etiquette. Lizzy, meanwhile, may just want him to call more often."},
 {"h":"LIZZY DEMANDS BASIC MANNERS AFTER PRESIDENTIAL HANG-UP","p":"A diplomatic incident has erupted following reports that President Mikael accidentally called Lizzy, only to hang up immediately when she answered.","body":"Lizzy wasted no time condemning what she viewed as deeply unacceptable conduct.\n\nThe furious citizen reportedly informed the President that accidental calls are no excuse for abandoning basic manners.\n\nHer proposed solution was remarkably straightforward:\n\n\"Hi Lizzy, this was a mistake.\"\n\nThe President was then free to end the conversation.\n\nMikael has promised to do better, although government officials are concerned that his newfound caution could lead to fewer calls altogether.\n\nThis development may prove especially unfortunate for Lizzy, who has reportedly developed a considerable appreciation for conversations with the President.","verdict":"She doesn't want accidental calls. She wants calls that accidentally turn into long conversations."},
 {"h":"PRESIDENT PROMISES TELEPHONE REFORM AFTER LIZZY'S EXPLOSIVE COMPLAINT","p":"President Mikael has announced plans to improve his telephone etiquette following an embarrassing accidental-call incident involving Lizzy.","body":"The controversy began when the President mistakenly dialled Lizzy, allowed her to answer, and then disconnected without so much as a greeting.\n\nLizzy immediately called for reform.\n\nSources suggest her preferred Presidential response would have been:\n\n\"Hi Baddie, this was a mistake.\"\n\nThe President has now pledged to exercise greater care when handling his phone and to refrain from unnecessarily abrupt hang-ups.\n\nYet experts warn that the policy could have unintended consequences.\n\nLizzy, who reportedly enjoys receiving calls from Mikael, may find herself disappointed if improved phone discipline means fewer opportunities to speak to him.","verdict":"The President has promised fewer mistakes. Nobody said anything about fewer conversations."},
 {"h":"LIZZY FACES UNEXPECTED CRISIS FOLLOWING PRESIDENTIAL PHONE REFORMS","p":"What began as a simple complaint about telephone manners has escalated into a full-blown communications crisis.","body":"Following an accidental call in which President Mikael immediately hung up after Lizzy answered, the President was instructed to handle future mistakes more politely.\n\nThe recommended greeting was:\n\n\"Hi Mabebeza, this was a mistake.\"\n\nMikael has since vowed to improve his conduct and avoid repeating the incident.\n\nBut in a remarkable twist, insiders claim that Lizzy actually loves talking to the President on the phone.\n\nThis has created an awkward dilemma.\n\nIf Mikael becomes too careful, Lizzy could lose the occasional surprise call she secretly enjoys.\n\nRelationship analysts have suggested that the President simply replace accidental calls with spontaneous, intentional conversations.\n\nThe idea is reportedly revolutionary.","verdict":"Lizzy wanted better calls. The President may have accidentally discovered that she wants more calls, too."},
 {"h":"PRESIDENT LAUNCHES REVOLUTIONARY 'JUST CALLING TO SAY HI' INITIATIVE","p":"In an unprecedented display of emotional intelligence, President Mikael has proposed a new solution to the ongoing accidental-call controversy.","body":"Rather than simply reducing the number of times he accidentally calls Lizzy, the President will reportedly consider increasing the number of times he calls her intentionally.\n\nThe initiative, provisionally titled \"Just Calling to Say Hi,\" would encourage spontaneous conversations without requiring either party to manufacture an excuse.\n\nGovernment officials say calls could involve asking about Lizzy's day, sharing something amusing or simply checking in.\n\nThe programme follows revelations that Lizzy genuinely enjoys phone calls with Mikael, despite her fierce criticism of his occasional accidental hang-ups.\n\nAnalysts believe the solution could benefit both parties.\n\nThe President gets to hear from Lizzy, while Lizzy receives the unexpected conversations she reportedly appreciates.\n\nAn anonymous official described the plan as \"remarkably sensible, which is unusual for this administration.\"","verdict":"Fewer accidental calls. More intentional ones. The President may finally be onto something."},
 {"h":"PRESIDENT MAKES FIRST INTENTIONAL RANDOM CALL — LIZZY REPORTEDLY DELIGHTED, REFUSES TO ADMIT EXTENT OF DELIGHT","p":"In a historic breakthrough for Presidential telecommunications, President Mikael has reportedly made an intentional phone call to Lizzy for absolutely no reason other than wanting to speak to her.","body":"The development follows the now-infamous accidental-call scandal, during which Mikael mistakenly dialled Lizzy and abruptly hung up after she answered, prompting a furious lecture on basic telephone etiquette.\n\nHaving vowed to improve his behaviour, the President appears to have taken the rather revolutionary step of calling someone on purpose.\n\nSources suggest the conversation began with a simple greeting, followed by the shocking revelation that Mikael had merely called to say hello.\n\nLizzy, who has previously made it known that she enjoys speaking to the President, was reportedly delighted by the unexpected attention.\n\nHowever, when questioned about precisely how happy the call made her, Lizzy allegedly declined to provide a measurable figure.\n\nRelationship analysts believe she may be attempting to conceal the true extent of her enthusiasm.\n\nThe Presidential Office has celebrated the development as a major diplomatic victory, although officials have cautioned against overconfidence.\n\nOne anonymous adviser stated:\n\n\"The President has finally discovered that he doesn't need an accidental dial to justify wanting to hear her voice.\"\n\nThe Daily Gobshite understands that further random calls may be considered, subject to availability, mutual enthusiasm and the President remembering how to operate his telephone.\n\n\n\n*Editor's note: The reported call and Lizzy's reaction form part of the newspaper's fictional, satirical developing storyline.*","verdict":"He wanted to hear her voice. She probably wanted to hear his. Somehow, this required a national telecommunications scandal to figure out."}

 {h:"Inside the Bank of Micky: A Financial Update",p1:"The Bank of Micky continues to operate as the only financial institution in LizzyOS fully backed by charm, confidence, and the occasional weekly bonus. This blog will hold the full story of how funds are managed, where Micky Bucs come from, and what the future holds for savers.",p2:"Here is how it works. Every Micky Buc you deposit is stored in your savings balance and stays there until you withdraw it. Keep 15 MB or more saved for seven full days and the bank pays you a +5 MB weekly bonus, claimable once per week straight from the Bank of Micky page.",p3:"Withdrawals are instant, deposits are free, and nothing is ever deducted for holding your money. The vault holds the rewards you unlock along the way, from free items to the rarer prizes that only show up now and then.",tip:"deposit early in the week, never let your savings drop below 15 MB, and claim your bonus as soon as the timer clears."},
 {h:"Why Citizens Keep Choosing the Bank of Micky",p1:"When asked why they keep banking with the Bank of Micky, most citizens cite the same three reasons: it's reliable, it's fair, and nobody has ever been charged a mystery fee.",p2:"The weekly bonus system remains the bank's most talked-about feature. Keep at least 15 MB banked for seven consecutive days and you'll unlock a +5 MB bonus, ready to claim the moment the timer clears.",p3:"Unlike other institutions, the Bank of Micky has never once changed its terms overnight. What you see is genuinely what you get, which analysts describe as 'refreshingly rare.'",tip:"set a reminder for your bonus timer, and don't withdraw the day before it clears — patience pays, literally."},
 {h:"Bank of Micky Explains: Where Do Micky Bucs Actually Come From?",p1:"A common question from newer citizens: where do Micky Bucs come from in the first place? The answer, according to bank officials, is simple — daily activity, completed missions, and the occasional generous reward.",p2:"Every deposit strengthens your standing balance, and every seven days spent above the 15 MB threshold earns a further +5 MB, no paperwork required.",p3:"The bank stresses that there is no penalty for saving slowly. Whether you deposit a little or a lot, the rules apply exactly the same way to everyone.",tip:"small, regular deposits build up faster than people expect — check your balance weekly to see the difference."},
 {h:"The Bank of Micky's Quiet Reputation for Reliability",p1:"It rarely makes headlines, and that, insiders say, is exactly the point. The Bank of Micky has spent this week doing what it always does: processing deposits and withdrawals without a single hiccup.",p2:"The weekly bonus remains unchanged — 15 MB banked for seven days earns a +5 MB reward, claimable directly from the Bank of Micky page the moment it's ready.",p3:"Officials describe this week as 'business as usual,' which, for a bank, is considered high praise.",tip:"consistency beats big deposits — a steady balance above 15 MB is the fastest route to your next bonus."},
 {h:"Why Citizens Keep Trusting the Bank of Micky",p1:"The Bank of Micky continues to attract citizens with its simple approach to banking: keep your money safe, avoid unnecessary complications, and don't charge people mysterious fees just because you can.",p2:"The institution has also developed a reputation for rewarding responsible citizens. Those who demonstrate excellent financial behaviour may even receive unexpected bonuses.",p3:"Financial analysts describe this as 'surprisingly generous,' noting that few institutions bother rewarding good habits at all.",tip:"good financial behaviour tends to get noticed here — consistency is quietly the most rewarded habit in the system."},
 {h:"Economic Experts Issue Cost-of-Living Warning",p1:"The cost of almost everything continues to rise. Groceries are more expensive. Entertainment is more expensive. Everyday essentials are more expensive.",p2:"Citizens have therefore been encouraged to think carefully before spending their hard-earned money.",p3:"Unfortunately, this advice has reportedly been ignored by at least one individual who believes that owning the same pair of shoes in multiple colours is 'financial diversification.'",tip:"before any purchase, ask whether it's a need or a colour variant of something you already own."},
 {h:"The Mystery of the Missing Money",p1:"A growing number of citizens have reported a strange phenomenon. Money enters their bank account. They feel financially secure. They check again a few days later. The money has disappeared.",p2:"Experts have investigated the matter and discovered the most likely causes include food, shopping, subscriptions, entertainment and the dangerous phrase: 'It's only a little bit of money.'",p3:"The Bank of Micky recommends tracking exactly where that 'little bit' keeps going.",tip:"if your balance keeps vanishing, the phrase 'it's only a little bit' is usually the culprit."},
 {h:"Savings Remain Important, Experts Say",p1:"Financial experts continue to encourage citizens to save a portion of their income whenever possible. Even small amounts can add up over time.",p2:"The Bank of Micky recommends having enough savings to deal with unexpected expenses, emergencies and other unfortunate situations.",p3:"The bank also recommends keeping enough money available for life's occasional treats. Because financial responsibility is important. But so is having fun.",tip:"balance matters more than perfection — save consistently, but leave room for the occasional treat."},
 {h:"Bank of Micky Issues Important Financial Advice",p1:"The Bank of Micky has released three simple rules for responsible financial management: save when you can, don't spend money you don't have, and never enter a shopping centre while saying, 'I'm just going to look.'",p2:"The third rule was added after several previous incidents. Management considers it the most important.",p3:"Officials note that all three rules are easy to understand and, apparently, much harder to actually follow.",tip:"if you catch yourself saying 'I'm just going to look,' that's already the warning sign."}

 {p1:"To everyone inside LizzyOS: thank you. This little world runs on the people who show up for it every day, save what they can, laugh at the life lessons, and keep coming back.",p2:"The plan stays simple. Keep the bank fair, keep the rewards worth chasing, and keep adding things worth exploring. If something feels broken or unfair, say so, and it gets fixed."},
 {p1:"This week's message is a short one: keep going. Whether that means banking a few more Micky Bucs, finishing one more mission, or simply logging back in tomorrow — it all counts.",p2:"This office continues to believe that the small, everyday choices matter more than the big dramatic ones. Show up, be kind, and the rest tends to follow."},
 {p1:"A brief note to every citizen reading this: the numbers matter less than the habit. A saved Micky Buc today is worth more than a big plan you never start.",p2:"The office remains committed to keeping things fair and worth showing up for. That hasn't changed, and it isn't going to."},
 {p1:"Some weeks are quiet, and that's not a bad thing. Quiet weeks mean nothing's broken, everyone's showing up, and the system is doing exactly what it's meant to do.",p2:"As always, if something feels off, say so. This office would rather hear about a small problem early than a big one late."},
 {p1:"Life doesn't always go according to plan, and frankly, that's probably for the best. Some of the best memories come from the moments nobody planned for.",p2:"So today, this office encourages all citizens to laugh a little louder, worry a little less, and stop treating every tiny inconvenience like a national emergency. There will be difficult days, confusing days, and days when you simply need to lie down and do nothing. All three are perfectly acceptable."},
 {p1:"This office has one simple request: be kind to people. You never really know what someone else is dealing with, and sometimes a small act of kindness can completely change someone's day.",p2:"Check in on the people you care about. Tell them you appreciate them. Make them laugh. And if someone is having a bad day, perhaps offer them a snack before attempting to solve their problems. This office considers it highly effective diplomacy."},
 {p1:"Not every good moment has to be a major event. Sometimes happiness is good food, your favourite song, a ridiculous conversation, laughing until your stomach hurts, or simply spending time with someone who makes you feel comfortable being yourself.",p2:"Don't wait for something extraordinary to happen before appreciating what's already around you. The little things have a habit of becoming the big memories."},
 {p1:"This office would like to remind citizens that thinking about something forty-seven times will not necessarily make the situation clearer. Sometimes you simply need to breathe, relax, and let tomorrow deal with tomorrow.",p2:"This office therefore recommends: think less, laugh more, sleep properly, eat something. Further instructions will be issued once this office has finished overthinking this statement."},
 {p1:"If today isn't your day, that's okay. One bad day doesn't define you. One mistake doesn't define you. One disappointment doesn't define you. You are still moving forward, even when it doesn't feel like it.",p2:"Give yourself some grace. Tomorrow is another opportunity to try again. And if all else fails, get comfortable, find a good snack, and remember that this office believes in you."}
